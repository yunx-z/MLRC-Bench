**The Solution for Single Object Tracking Task of Perception Test Challenge 2024**

This report details the first-place winning method for the Single Object Tracking (SOT) task in the Perception Test Challenge 2024, achieving a score of 0.813. The core of their solution is the **LoRAT (Tracking meets LoRA)** model, which adapts LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for visual tracking. LoRA allows fine-tuning a small subset of model parameters efficiently without adding inference latency.

Key aspects of their LoRAT implementation include:
1.  **LoRA-friendly Model Design:** Adjustments were made to the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, such as using **decoupled input embeddings** (token-type embeddings to distinguish template/search regions and foreground/background, and adaptable positional embeddings for varying input sizes) to make it suitable for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
2.  **MLP-only Head Network:** A multi-layer perceptron head was employed for classification and bounding box regression (using a center-based, anchor-free style) to reduce potential inductive biases from convolutional heads.

The model was trained on the **Perception Test dataset** and significantly augmented with the extensive **LaSOT and GOT-10k datasets** to enhance robustness and generalization. While an **alpha-refine technique** was implemented for post-processing bounding box outputs, it did not yield the anticipated performance improvements.

Comparative experiments showed the base LoRAT model (0.802 average IoU) outperforming methods like SiamFC (0.658) and SAM2 (0.693). Ablation studies revealed that a larger LoRAT model (LoRAT-L-378) achieved 0.810 IoU, and further training with the LaSOT and GOT-10k datasets boosted this score to the final 0.813. The alpha-refine method, when applied, slightly decreased performance.

In conclusion, the team's success stemmed from selecting the LoRAT model, adapting it for efficient fine-tuning, and leveraging diverse training datasets, which collectively led to their top ranking in the challenge.
