Technical Approaches and Methodologies:
The availability of watermarking methodology information enables more targeted approaches to watermark removal. An et al. (2024) demonstrate that different watermarking techniques exhibit distinct vulnerabilities that can be specifically targeted. For instance:

Frequency Domain Analysis: When the watermarking method's frequency characteristics are known, precise frequency domain transformations can be designed. DCT and DWT transformations can be specifically tuned to target known watermark insertion points while minimizing impact on image quality. This approach is particularly effective when the watermark's frequency domain properties are disclosed.

Neural Network Architectures: The WAVES benchmark (An et al., 2024) shows that specialized neural networks can be designed for specific watermarking methods. Autoencoders can be trained to recognize and remove specific watermark patterns, while GANs can be configured to generate clean images that specifically counter known watermarking techniques. Model architecture and training strategies can be optimized based on the watermarking method's characteristics.

Model Merging Strategies: Knowledge of watermarking techniques enables the development of specialized expert models for each method. These models can then be merged using advanced techniques like TIES and Dare merging, creating robust solutions that maintain effectiveness across multiple known watermarking approaches. The merging process can be optimized based on known watermark characteristics.

Advanced Research Directions:
Recent work by An et al. (2024) has revealed that knowledge of watermarking techniques enables more sophisticated attack strategies. Their research shows that different watermarking methods have distinct vulnerabilities that can be specifically targeted. The key innovation in the beige-box context lies in developing specialized attack vectors for each known watermarking technique while maintaining the ability to generalize across similar methods.

The TIES merging method has proven particularly effective in the beige-box setting, as it can combine multiple expert models, each specialized for a specific watermarking technique. This approach allows for optimal handling of known watermarking methods while maintaining computational efficiency. The Dare merging approach further enhances this by introducing targeted dropout mechanisms based on watermark characteristics.

Implementation and Practical Considerations:
In the beige-box context, implementation focuses on developing modular solutions that can adapt to different known watermarking techniques. This requires:
1. Development of specialized attack modules for each watermarking method
2. Efficient switching mechanisms between different attack strategies
3. Resource optimization based on watermark characteristics
4. Quality preservation techniques tailored to specific watermark types
