Weather4cast 2023 Research Problem

The Weather4cast 2023 competition focuses on predicting future radar reflectivity from satellite data. This is a crucial task for weather forecasting and early warning systems, especially in regions where ground radar coverage is limited or non-existent.

Research Questions:
1. How can we effectively use satellite imagery to predict precipitation patterns?
2. What deep learning architectures are most effective for spatio-temporal forecasting of weather phenomena?
3. How can we handle the inherent uncertainty in weather prediction?

Task Description:
- Input: Satellite imagery from various channels over a sequence of time steps
- Output: Predicted radar reflectivity for future time steps
- Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on their ability to predict future radar reflectivity using metrics like RMSE

Challenges:
- Weather phenomena are complex and chaotic systems
- Satellite data and radar data have different resolutions and characteristics
- Precipitation events are rare, leading to class imbalance
- Weather patterns vary by region and season

The goal is to develop models that can accurately predict precipitation patterns from satellite data, which would significantly improve weather forecasting capabilities, especially in regions with limited ground radar coverage.
